A prototype movement FPS game I created between 2020 - 2021, it features rocket jumping and rudimentary grappling hook mechanics. 

## Controls:
WASD to move
Spacebar to jump
L Ctrl to crouch
RMB to grab physics objects
F to freeze physics object
F to unfreeze (only works while holding RMB to grab the frozen object)
LMB to fire weapon
1/2 to switch between rocket launcher and grappling gun.
Fire at the ground to rocket jump
